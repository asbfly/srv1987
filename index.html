<P><FONT SIZE=5>I've had these pictures from the day of the concert in my little blue picture book and I have been wanting to share these with everyone for a while now. So here you will find pictures from the show, pictures of SRV and me, and a little back ground on the photographer, Tom. I still wonder today how Tom managed to get up front stage for most of the show and snap pictures with my crappy disposable camera. Unfortunately, I'll never know.</P>
<P>So, here you go. Never-before-seen pitures of Stevie Ray Vaughan. Yup. That's right.</P>
<P>We can all thank Tom</P>
<P>Enjoy,</P>

<H1>How I met Stevie Ray Vaughan</H1>
<P>I met Stevie Ray Vaughan during the Live Alive tour in my home town of Montreal, Canada. I was 17 years old. He performed a show at the La Ronde Amusement Park on July 22, 1987.</P> 
<P>La Ronde is an Amusement Park which had recently installed a concert stage and had pretty big performers.  I recall going to the show armed with my beige leather Martin Guitars guitar strap and Sharpie with hope that I might meet my idol. I had been playing guitar since I was about 13 years old.</P>
<BR CLEAR=”right” />
<P>Having a ticket for the Stevie Ray Vaughan show entitled you to access the Park and all the rides. My best friend Marco came with me. He wasn’t the a huge SRV fan that I was. But he appreciated his great playing. The show was scheduled to start in the evening but we went early in the day to for the rides. 
<P>My encounter with SRV begins in the early afterboon, before the show that evening, when Marco and I took a ride in a gondola which ran across the whole park. I remember riding high above and hearing the chugging riff from “Change It”. I figured that there was a sound check going on and told my friend that we should get off and go find the stage.</P>
<P>We arrived at the front gates and could barely see the stage. We couldn’t even see SRV from there. I looked around and noticed that there were two exit paths from the stage: one backstage and one frontstage. The frontstage exit led to the seating area and over to where we were. The backstage led to a small artificial lake with no other way to land. Off to the side there was a small one story building that was fenced off. I told my friend that we should go over there and hope that SRV shows up.</P>
<P>A little later, while we were waiting and talking, Marco said to me “Dave, turn around”. I did. I was in awe when I noticed SRV about 40 feet from me, near the blue garbage bins in the pictures, about to enter the building. I called, “Stevie!”. He turned and saw us wanting to meet him. I was wearing a SRV shirt with the “Texas Flood” album cover. It was my favorite shirt. Stevie stopped and noticed us and made his way over. I sat on this platform and asked him to sign my strap, which he did. It was a beautiful signature. He took the time to write his name very nicely and wrote “87” at the end. While he signed it I told him “I love you Stevie”. I think he chuckled a little. Side note that unfortunatly, today the signature on the stap is completely faded away. So, I then had the forethought to ask Marco to take a picture of the two of us. He took two. I still feel bad today that I didn’t think to offer to take a picture of Marco with Stevie. So a minute or so later Stevie went back into the building. I don’t remember exactly how I felt but I’m sure I was on cloud 9.</P> 
<P>We spent the rest of the day on the rides until the start of the show. While being protective of my strap, we went to the auditorium when it was show time. There was no opening act in Montreal. Too bad because there were some great opening acts on that tour in other cities. Have a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Alive_Tour. I would have loved to see Omar and Howlers, Lonnie Mack, or the Fabulous Thunderbirds. We proceeded to find our seats once we entered through the turnstiles. It was at this point that I ran into Tom. It wasn’t surprising to see him but I hadn’t seen him in a while. I showed him my strap which he thought was very cool. I didn’t want to flash it around too much in case someone got the idea to steal it. I told him I got some pictures of him earlier on and he said “Gimme your camera”. So I did. He told me, “meet me at the entrance after the show”. Tom turned around and disappeared.  It was a disposable camera that would get thrown away after the pictures were developed. But my precious picture with Stevie and me was on it. I reluctantly trusted him to bring it back. Glad I did. I met him after the show and he handed me the camera.
</P>
<P>
I took them to get my treasured camera to the photomat to have the pictures developped. Duplicates cost a dollar in those days so I got two copies and gave one set to Marco. I felt bad once again that we didn’t have a picture with Stevie. 
</P>
So I share with you the result of my faith in Tom. Somehow he managed to get pictures of the whole show from the front of the stage. The pictures were way better than I could have ever taken.

<H1>About Tom... </H1><I>the photographer of the concert shots below, and how I started playing guitar</I>
<P>My sister had a boyfriend called Tom when I was 13. He heard I wanted to play the guitar. So he gave me an old Hondo acoustic guitar that was barely playable. But I stuck with it for one year before getting my first electric guitar. It wasn’t a Strat. But it was a good Vantage guitar which I eventually butchered because I really wanted to put a whammy bar on it. Armed with a chisel, a hammer, and Khaler I rendered my guitar unplayable. I did eventally get a used 1983 JV Squire Strat for $250 a little later which I still have today. Tom also had a Fender Twin so I wanted one too. I eventually got a 1969 Silverface for $200 at some point in the late 80’s. I still have it. It’s loud but I won’t get rid of it. 
</P>
<P>
So thank you Tom for giving me a guitar and teaching me so much. Tom loved blues. I didn’t at first. But I became obsessed with blues and bought hundreds of recordings. Unfortunately Tom passed away in 2009 due to a heart attack while playing hockey <A HREF="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/tom-hanson-award-winning-canadian-press-photographer-dies-at-41-1.835145"> https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/tom-hanson-award-winning-canadian-press-photographer-dies-at-41-1.83514</A>). He was about 41.</P> 
<P>My sister and Tom did break up at one point but they remained friends. So did we. I would run into him from time to time. Later on I remember meeting him at the Blues stage at the Montreal Jazz fest. We hung out until 6 AM. I remember a fire truck going by as we exited Mike's Pizzeria on St Catherine. He said, “Dave, get in the car” and proceeded to try to find that truck. Tom was a budding photographer and was looking for action shots he could sell. He eventually became a well know and respected professional photograper for the Canadian Press. We never found the fire but we ended up at his place to jam.</P>
<P>I could play a little blues but it was the first time I ever jammed with anyone. We both plugged into his Twin. I didn’t know what to play when it was my turn to solo. He said “just play”. And I did and that was the start of a lifelong musical journey. .
